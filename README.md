 Phantom Powered Pink noise generator

Plug it into a +48V Phantom Powered mic preamp to create pink noise.

A reverse biased BJT provides noise, a op amp gain stage comes next, followed by an op amp filter stage, which does its best to turn white noise into pink noise. the output is impedance balanced.
